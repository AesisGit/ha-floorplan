#### Work in progress...

We're still working on the **Create your first SVG-file** guide.

While waiting, where's actually a good guide called [Creating your own custom floorplan-file from scratch](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan/blob/master/own-floorplan-svg-file-tutorial.md) in our old repo. Please note that the YAML-code mentioned in that guide are for the **old** version. Therefore, please use our [examples](./docs/examples/), if you need any inspiration in where to start with the YAML-code.
