_If you're searching for a specific option, head over to the [Home Assistant Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/floorplan-now-available-as-a-lovelace-card/115489/334). Where's also good examples here in our docs, but we'll do our best to get the **Options** page done, as fast as possible._
