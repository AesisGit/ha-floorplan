#### Work in progress...

We're still working on the **Usage** page.


While waiting, checkout our [examples](./docs/examples/). If you're searching for a specific option, head over to the [Home Assistant Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/floorplan-now-available-as-a-lovelace-card/115489/334).

If you're still struggling to find the proper needs, checkout out [Discussion area on GitHub](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan/discussions) too. There's a good amount of both questions and answers to specific needs.
