## Story

[Petar Ko≈æul](https://github.com/orgs/ExperienceLovelace/people/pkozul) started the first version of ha-floorplan. With Lovelace, Petar turned [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan) into a supported module for lovelace, too. The old lovelace-version was called [lovelace-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/lovelace-floorplan). [Tobias Nordahl Kristensen](https://github.com/orgs/ExperienceLovelace/people/exetico) joined the ha-floorplan project in a period, where nothing really changed in the repo. After a huge pull-request, lovelace-floorplan finally supported HACS. What Tobias didn't know, was that Petar had working on a brand new base-code, which was much more modern - and improved both options, performance and general usage, too.

We moved the lovelace-floorplan to the new team called [ExperinceLovelace](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace). After a few weeks of testing and improvements to the new codebase, we finally released the first version of the new [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan) (Yep, that's the current one).

## Your imagination (almost) defines the limits
With [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan) we finally have a module which allow you to create tons of things. Create a SVG, and map one or many entities to it. 

The primary usage is floorplans, but you're able to create whatever you need. You're able to import a normal image to a SVG-file, so it's possible to do many things with it. Therefore, kindly head over to our examplesarea, if you're ready to see [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan) in action.

## About the docs
Our docs are generated by Jekyll, and powered by the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)) theme. There's plenty of ways of doing [formatting](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/edit/master/docs/_posts/2013-01-11-markup-html-tags-and-formatting.md)), and the [helpers](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/), [layouts](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/) and [utility classes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/utility-classes/) are all awesome. Minimal Mistakes can be used free of charge, and can be posted with GitHub Pages - like our docs. We'd just like to give a big shout-out to [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes), for a great Jekyll theme. Thanks!
