Bring new life to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) with Floorplan. By mapping entities to SVG images, you're able to show states, control devices, call services - and much more. Use your own custom styles to visualize whatever you can think of. Your imagination becomes the new limit.

And remember: Although it's typically used to represent the floorplan of your home, you can use Floorplan for anything. A music box? No problem. A Ring doorbell? Bring it on. A remote control for your legacy TV with IR control? Yep, that can be done, too.

      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title" itemprop="headline">See it in action</h1>
        <p class="page__lead">Here's a real world example of how to use ha-floorplan, with a floorplan created with Floorplanner. This is just a simple example of how to get started.
